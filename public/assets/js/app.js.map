The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this[lib$es6$promise$$internal$$PROMISE_ID] = lib$es6$promise$$internal$$nextId();\n      this._result = this._state = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled.

This technique is less readable, but more efficient.\n\t\t\t\t\tif (time === 0 && isComplete) { //if there's a zero-duration tween at the very beginning of a timeline and the playhead lands EXACTLY at time 0, that tween will correctly render its end values, but we need to keep the timeline alive for one more render so that the beginning values render properly as the parent's playhead keeps moving beyond the begining. Imagine obj.x starts at 0 and then we do tl.set(obj, {x:100}).to(obj, 1, {x:200}) and then later we tl.reverse()...the goal is to have obj.x revert to 0.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.  This is what we feed to the external _onInitTween() as the target\n\t\t\t *  - end: a generic object containing the ending values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin. This is what we feed to the external plugin's _onInitTween() as the destination values\n\t\t\t *  - firstMPT: the first MiniPropTween in the linked list\n\t\t\t *  - pt: the first CSSPropTween in the linked list that was created when parsing.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} b Beginning value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what it was when the tween began without any risk of interpretation issues.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} e Ending value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what the user defined at the end of the tween without any risk of interpretation issues.\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tCSSPropTween = _internals.CSSPropTween = function(t, p, s, c, next, type, n, r, pr, b, e) {\n\t\t\t\tthis.t = t; //target\n\t\t\t\tthis.p = p; //property\n\t\t\t\tthis.s = s; //starting value\n\t\t\t\tthis.c = c; //change value\n\t\t\t\tthis.n = n || p; //name that this CSSPropTween should be associated to (usually the same as p, but not always - n is what overwriting looks at)\n\t\t\t\tif (!(t instanceof CSSPropTween)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t_overwriteProps.push(this.n);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tthis.r = r; //round (boolean)\n\t\t\t\tthis.type = type || 0; //0 = normal tween, -1 = non-tweening (in which case xs0 will be applied to the target's property, like tp.t[tp.p] = tp.xs0), 1 = complex-value SpecialProp, 2 = custom setRatio() that does all the work\n\t\t\t\tif (pr) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.pr = pr;\n\t\t\t\t\t_hasPriority = true;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tthis.b = (b === undefined) ? s : b;\n\t\t\t\tthis.e = (e === undefined) ? s + c : e;\n\t\t\t\tif (next) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis._next = next;\n\t\t\t\t\tnext._prev = this;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t},\n\n\t\t\t_addNonTweeningNumericPT = function(target, prop, start, end, next, overwriteProp) { //cleans up some code redundancies and helps minification.

For example:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp(\"myCustomProp\", function(target, value, tween) {\n\t\t *      var start = target.style.width;\n\t\t *      return function(ratio) {\n\t\t *              target.style.width = (start + value * ratio) + \"px\";\n\t\t *              console.log(\"set width to \" + target.style.width);\n\t\t *          }\n\t\t * }, 0);\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});\n\t\t *\n\t\t * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define \"myCustomProp\", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})\n\t\t * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween. That function will receive a single parameter that is a \"change factor\" value (typically between 0 and 1) indicating the amount of change as a ratio. You can use this to determine how to set the values appropriately in your function.\n\t\t * @param {number=} priority Priority that helps the engine determine the order in which to set the properties (default: 0).

The reason this functionality is\n\t\t * wrapped into a separate static method of CSSPlugin instead of being integrated into all regular className tweens\n\t\t * is because it creates entirely new tweens that may have completely different targets than the original tween,\n\t\t * so if they were all lumped into the original tween instance, it would be inconsistent with the rest of the API\n\t\t * and it would create other problems. For example:\n\t\t *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)\n\t\t *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.\n\t\t *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {Object} target object to be tweened\n\t\t * @param {number} Duration in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens)\n\t\t * @param {Object} Object containing the end values, like {className:\"newClass\", ease:Linear.easeNone}\n\t\t * @return {Array} An array of TweenLite instances\n\t\t */\n\t\tCSSPlugin.cascadeTo = function(target, duration, vars) {\n\t\t\tvar tween = TweenLite.to(target, duration, vars),\n\t\t\t\tresults = [tween],\n\t\t\t\tb = [],\n\t\t\t\te = [],\n\t\t\t\ttargets = [],\n\t\t\t\t_reservedProps = TweenLite._internals.reservedProps,\n\t\t\t\ti, difs, p, from;\n\t\t\ttarget = tween._targets || tween.target;\n\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, b, targets);\n\t\t\ttween.render(duration, true, true);\n\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, e);\n\t\t\ttween.render(0, true, true);\n\t\t\ttween._enabled(true);\n\t\t\ti = targets.length;\n\t\t\twhile (--i > -1) {\n\t\t\t\tdifs = _cssDif(targets[i], b[i], e[i]);\n\t\t\t\tif (difs.firstMPT) {\n\t\t\t\t\tdifs = difs.difs;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in vars) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (_reservedProps[p]) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs[p] = vars[p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom = {};\n\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in difs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom[p] = b[i][p];\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tresults.push(TweenLite.fromTo(targets[i], duration, from, difs));\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn results;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tTweenPlugin.activate([CSSPlugin]);\n\t\treturn CSSPlugin;\n\n\t}, true);\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n/*\n * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n * RoundPropsPlugin\n * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n */\n\t(function() {\n\n\t\tvar RoundPropsPlugin = _gsScope._gsDefine.plugin({\n\t\t\t\tpropName: \"roundProps\",\n\t\t\t\tversion: \"1.6.0\",\n\t\t\t\tpriority: -1,\n\t\t\t\tAPI: 2,\n\n\t\t\t\t//called when the tween renders for the first time.

It exposes methods\n * and properties that enable you to programmatically change the map,\n * and fires events as users interact with it.\n *\n * You create a `Map` by specifying a `container` and other options.\n * Then Mapbox GL JS initializes the map on the page and returns your `Map`\n * object.\n *\n * The `Map` class mixes in [`Evented`](#Evented) methods.\n *\n * @class Map\n * @param {Object} options\n * @param {HTMLElement|string} options.container The HTML element in which Mapbox GL JS will render the map, or the element's string `id`.\n * @param {number} [options.minZoom=0] The minimum zoom level of the map (1-20).\n * @param {number} [options.maxZoom=20] The maximum zoom level of the map (1-20).\n * @param {Object|string} [options.style] The map's Mapbox style. This must be an a JSON object conforming to\n * the schema described in the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), or a URL to\n * such JSON.\n *\n * To load a style from the Mapbox API, you can use a URL of the form `mapbox://styles/:owner/:style`,\n * where `:owner` is your Mapbox account name and `:style` is the style ID. Or you can use one of the following\n * [the predefined Mapbox styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/):\n *\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9`\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v9`\n *\n * @param {boolean} [options.hash=false] If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, and bearing) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.\n *   For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1`.\n * @param {boolean} [options.interactive=true] If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners will be attached to the map, so it will not respond to interaction.\n * @param {number} [options.bearingSnap=7] The threshold, measured in degrees, that determines when the map's\n *   bearing (rotation) will snap to north. For example, with a `bearingSnap` of 7, if the user rotates\n *   the map within 7 degrees of north, the map will automatically snap to exact north.\n * @param {Array<string>} [options.classes] Mapbox style class names with which to initialize the map.\n *   Keep in mind that these classes are used for controlling a style layer's paint properties, so are *not* reflected\n *   in an HTML element's `class` attribute. To learn more about Mapbox style classes, read about\n *   [Layers](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/#layers) in the style specification.\n * @param {boolean} [options.attributionControl=true] If `true`, an [Attribution](#Attribution) control will be added to the map.\n * @param {boolean} [options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat=false] If `true`, map creation will fail if the performance of Mapbox\n *   GL JS would be dramatically worse than expected (i.e. a software renderer would be used).\n * @param {boolean} [options.preserveDrawingBuffer=false] If `true`, the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.\n * @param {LngLatBoundsLike} [options.maxBounds] If set, the map will be constrained to the given bounds.\n * @param {boolean} [options.scrollZoom=true] If `true`, the \"scroll to zoom\" interaction is enabled (see [`ScrollZoomHandler`](#ScrollZoomHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.boxZoom=true] If `true`, the \"box zoom\" interaction is enabled (see [`BoxZoomHandler`](#BoxZoomHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragRotate=true] If `true`, the \"drag to rotate\" interaction is enabled (see [`DragRotateHandler`](#DragRotateHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragPan=true] If `true`, the \"drag to pan\" interaction is enabled (see [`DragPanHandler`](#DragPanHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.keyboard=true] If `true`, keyboard shortcuts are enabled (see [`KeyboardHandler`](#KeyboardHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.doubleClickZoom=true] If `true`, the \"double click to zoom\" interaction is enabled (see [`DoubleClickZoomHandler`](#DoubleClickZoomHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.touchZoomRotate=true] If `true`, the \"pinch to rotate and zoom\" interaction is enabled (see [`TouchZoomRotateHandler`](#TouchZoomRotateHandler)).\n * @param {boolean} [options.trackResize=true]  If `true`, the map will automatically resize when the browser window resizes.\n * @param {LngLatLike} [options.center=[0, 0]] The inital geographical centerpoint of the map. If `center` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `[0, 0]`.\n * @param {number} [options.zoom=0] The initial zoom level of the map. If `zoom` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.bearing=0] The initial bearing (rotation) of the map, measured in degrees counter-clockwise from north. If `bearing` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.pitch=0] The initial pitch (tilt) of the map, measured in degrees away from the plane of the screen (0-60). If `pitch` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\n * @param {number} [options.workerCount=navigator.hardwareConcurrency - 1] The number of WebWorkers that Mapbox GL JS should use to process vector tile data.\n * @example\n * var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n *   container: 'map',\n *   center: [-122.420679, 37.772537],\n *   zoom: 13,\n *   style: style_object,\n *   hash: true\n * });\n */\nvar Map = module.exports = function(options) {\n\n    options = util.extend({}, defaultOptions, options);\n\n    if (options.workerCount < 1) {\n        throw new Error('workerCount must an integer greater than or equal to 1.');\n    }\n\n    this._interactive = options.interactive;\n    this._failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat = options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat;\n    this._preserveDrawingBuffer = options.preserveDrawingBuffer;\n    this._trackResize = options.trackResize;\n    this._workerCount = options.workerCount;\n    this._bearingSnap = options.bearingSnap;\n\n    if (typeof options.container === 'string') {\n        this._container = document.getElementById(options.container);\n    } else {\n        this._container = options.container;\n    }\n\n    this.animationLoop = new AnimationLoop();\n    this.transform = new Transform(options.minZoom, options.maxZoom);\n\n    if (options.maxBounds) {\n        this.setMaxBounds(options.maxBounds);\n    }\n\n    util.bindAll([\n        '_forwardStyleEvent',\n        '_forwardSourceEvent',\n        '_forwardLayerEvent',\n        '_forwardTileEvent',\n        '_onStyleLoad',\n        '_onStyleChange',\n        '_onSourceAdd',\n        '_onSourceRemove',\n        '_onSourceUpdate',\n        '_onWindowOnline',\n        '_onWindowResize',\n        'onError',\n        '_update',\n        '_render'\n    ], this);\n\n    this._setupContainer();\n    this._setupPainter();\n\n    this.on('move', this._update.bind(this, false));\n    this.on('zoom', this._update.bind(this, true));\n    this.on('moveend', function() {\n        this.animationLoop.set(300); // text fading\n        this._rerender();\n    }.bind(this));\n\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n        window.addEventListener('online', this._onWindowOnline, false);\n        window.addEventListener('resize', this._onWindowResize, false);\n    }\n\n    bindHandlers(this, options);\n\n    this._hash = options.hash && (new Hash()).addTo(this);\n    // don't set position from options if set through hash\n    if (!this._hash || !this._hash._onHashChange()) {\n        this.jumpTo({\n            center: options.center,\n            zoom: options.zoom,\n            bearing: options.bearing,\n            pitch: options.pitch\n        });\n    }\n\n    this.stacks = {};\n    this._classes = [];\n\n    this.resize();\n\n    if (options.classes) this.setClasses(options.classes);\n    if (options.style) this.setStyle(options.style);\n    if (options.attributionControl) this.addControl(new Attribution(options.attributionControl));\n\n    this.on('error', this.onError);\n    this.on('style.error', this.onError);\n    this.on('source.error', this.onError);\n    this.on('tile.error', this.onError);\n    this.on('layer.error', this.onError);\n};\n\nutil.extend(Map.prototype, Evented);\nutil.extend(Map.prototype, Camera.prototype);\nutil.extend(Map.prototype, /** @lends Map.prototype */{\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a [`Control`](#Control) to the map, calling `control.addTo(this)`.\n     *\n     * @param {Control} control The [`Control`](#Control) to add.\n     * @returns {Map} `this`\n     */\n    addControl: function(control) {\n        control.addTo(this);\n        return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a Mapbox style class to the map.\n     *\n     * Keep in mind that these classes are used for controlling a style layer's paint properties, so are *not* reflected\n     * in an HTML element's `class` attribute.

*\n * @class GeoJSONSource\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {Object|string} [options.data] A GeoJSON data object or a URL to one. The latter is preferable in the case of large GeoJSON objects.\n * @param {number} [options.maxzoom=18] The maximum zoom level at which to preserve detail (1-20).\n * @param {number} [options.buffer=128] The tile buffer, measured in pixels. The buffer extends each\n *   tile's data just past its visible edges, helping to ensure seamless rendering across tile boundaries.\n *   The default value, 128, is a safe value for label layers, preventing text clipping at boundaries.\n *   You can read more about buffers and clipping in the\n *   [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/#clipping).\n * @param {number} [options.tolerance=0.375] The simplification tolerance, measured in pixels.\n *   This value is passed into a modified [Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm)\n *   to simplify (i.e. reduce the number of points) in curves. Higher values result in greater simplification.\n * @param {boolean} [options.cluster] If `true`, a collection of point features will be clustered into groups,\n *   according to `options.clusterRadius`.\n * @param {number} [options.clusterRadius=50] The radius of each cluster when clustering points, measured in pixels.\n * @param {number} [options.clusterMaxZoom] The maximum zoom level to cluster points in. By default, this value is\n *   one zoom level less than the map's `maxzoom`, so that at the highest zoom level features are not clustered.\n\n * @example\n * var sourceObj = new mapboxgl.GeoJSONSource({\n *    data: {\n *        \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n *        \"features\": [{\n *            \"type\": \"Feature\",\n *            \"geometry\": {\n *                \"type\": \"Point\",\n *                \"coordinates\": [\n *                    -76.53063297271729,\n *                    39.18174077994108\n *                ]\n *            }\n *        }]\n *    }\n * });\n * map.addSource('some id', sourceObj); // add\n * map.removeSource('some id');  // remove\n */\nfunction GeoJSONSource(options) {\n    options = options || {};\n\n    this._data = options.data;\n\n    if (options.maxzoom !== undefined) this.maxzoom = options.maxzoom;\n\n    var scale = EXTENT / this.tileSize;\n\n    this.geojsonVtOptions = {\n        buffer: (options.buffer !== undefined ? options.buffer : 128) * scale,\n        tolerance: (options.tolerance !== undefined ? options.tolerance : 0.375) * scale,\n        extent: EXTENT,\n        maxZoom: this.maxzoom\n    };\n\n    this.cluster = options.cluster || false;\n    this.superclusterOptions = {\n        maxZoom: Math.min(options.clusterMaxZoom, this.maxzoom - 1) || (this.maxzoom - 1),\n        extent: EXTENT,\n        radius: (options.clusterRadius || 50) * scale,\n        log: false\n    };\n\n    this._pyramid = new TilePyramid({\n        tileSize: this.tileSize,\n        minzoom: this.minzoom,\n        maxzoom: this.maxzoom,\n        reparseOverscaled: true,\n        load: this._loadTile.bind(this),\n        abort: this._abortTile.bind(this),\n        unload: this._unloadTile.bind(this),\n        add: this._addTile.bind(this),\n        remove: this._removeTile.bind(this),\n        redoPlacement: this._redoTilePlacement.bind(this)\n    });\n}\n\nGeoJSONSource.prototype = util.inherit(Evented, /** @lends GeoJSONSource.prototype */{\n    minzoom: 0,\n    maxzoom: 18,\n    tileSize: 512,\n    _dirty: true,\n    isTileClipped: true,\n\n    /**\n     * Sets the GeoJSON data and re-renders the map.\n     *\n     * @param {Object|string} data A GeoJSON data object or a URL to one.
